The following formula linearly correlates with HellaSwag scores at the [Open LLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard).

(26 models in correlation)

Correlation at 200 lines: `y = 77.55 x + 23.46`
</br>R2 = 0.8636

Correlation at 400 lines: `y = 82.79 x + 27.06`
</br>R2 = 0.9049

where `x = (ppl_wrong â€“ ppl_correct) / ppl_correct`
